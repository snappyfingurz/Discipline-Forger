🔥 DisciplineForger

DisciplineForger is a fantasy progression game where your real-life actions shape a living world.
Complete daily tasks, grow your stats, explore floating biomes, and face mythic bosses. The real goal isn’t just winning — it’s building consistency.

🎮 What is DisciplineForger?

DisciplineForger turns habits into gameplay.

You create real-life tasks and assign them to mystical biomes.
Each completed task grants Courage, Strength, or Intelligence.
At the end of the day, you return to the world, rest at the campfire, and choose when to face powerful bosses.

The more consistent you are, the higher your chances of victory.
